okay so basically this game is all about expanding out and terraforming new planets to keep your population alive
UPDATE GOALS:
1-to finalize a terraforming system, and build more research topics. also see if i can improve the functionality of the refreshing system
2-make a way to leave the solar system and finish developing the galaxy
3- find a way to package save files
4- add more research topics and maybe build a dedicated research screen.
5- add ELE and populations, along with the timer to move off earth
